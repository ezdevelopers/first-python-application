This project is connected to the Programming Foundations with Python course, but depending on your background knowledge you may not need the entirety of the course to complete this project. Here's what you should do:

1. Install Python
2. Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.
3. Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.
4. To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a starter code repository that contains a Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py. 
5. To get started, fork this repository to create your own copy in GitHub. Then clone your ud036_StarterCode repository to work on this project locally on your computer. The fresh_tomatoes.py module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies, and creates an HTML file which will display all of your favorite movies.
6. Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser.
